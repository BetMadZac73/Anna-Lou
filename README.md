 Anna-Lou Art Gallery

My Sister is an Artist, and she has been posting these images up on FaceBook and Instagram, but I thought maybe it would be a cool idea to create a gallery page for her. 

Now for smeone who isn't familiar with coding - making and maintianing a web-page seems a little bit scary, however I thought about and decided:-

1. Create a gallery layout that is clean and simple (I've nominated two different styles here) 
2. Embed a javascript that usese a counter, and then just add Image files with numbered counter and then all that is required to maintain the content on the site is
3. using github desktop, add the files, then update the counter in the html file so when the javascript runs it shows the new files. 

Now I am just waiting to see if my sister likes the idea and will want to take it up and take it over - then I need to go train her how to do that. 

BetMadZac.
